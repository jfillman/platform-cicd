#
# Runs as an ArgoCD PostSync/SyncFail hook Job on a cluster-mapped upper-env cluster -
# reports a confirmed release outcome straight to the dev cluster's
# argocd-outcome-relay. Replaces an earlier ArgoCD-Notifications design: Notifications
# fired on any completed sync (including pure selfHeal drift, no release involved), and
# reading per-release data off the Application object's own metadata was racy against
# the app-of-apps root's independent reconcile loop. A hook Job avoids both - it only
# runs when its own sync had something to apply, PostSync only fires once healthy, and
# every value here is an env var baked in by open-release-pr.yaml at commit time
# instead of read live. See docs/admin/multi-cluster.md.
#
# PHASE is baked in per-hook-type (Succeeded/Failed) rather than discovered live -
# which hook ran already tells us the outcome.
#
# This script builds the full CDEvents envelope itself (mirroring catalog/lib/
# cdevents.sh's shape - not sourcing that file directly, since its cdevent_send
# assumes an in-cluster broker-audience SA token this hook Job, running on a remote
# cluster, doesn't have) and sends it to argocd-outcome-relay as-is. The relay's only
# job is authenticating this call (shared secret, since TokenReview can't validate a
# token from a different cluster's API server) and forwarding the same bytes on to the
# broker with its own credentials - it no longer reshapes a flat request into a
# CDEvent. See argocd-outcome-relay/main.go's header for the other side of this split.

# CHAIN_ID is optional, unlike the required fields above - it feeds
# release-outcome-span.yaml's Tempo correlation, and making it required would break

# read here too, but never round-trip through git/this hook Job any more - they can't be
# known at PR-open commit time (the PR doesn't exist yet), and a second commit to add
# them once it did re-triggered every governance gate on the gitops repo a second time
# on every release. release-outcome-notify.yaml's resolve-release-tracking Task reads
# them straight from a dev-cluster ConfigMap instead - see open-release-pr.yaml's header.

# Shared per-cluster secret, hand-provisioned once per app namespace on THIS cluster -
