# Emits CDEvents (https://cdevents.dev) to the shared internal broker, chaining
# independently-triggered PipelineRuns (build -> test -> deploy -> release). Assembles
# both chainId (CDEvents' causal-sequence correlator) and platform.traceparent (the
# separate W3C trace context stitching one Tempo trace across the whole flow) - see
# docs/admin/chaining.md and docs/admin/tracing.md.
#
# Auth: the pipeline pod's own audience-bound projected ServiceAccount token, sent as a
# bearer token and verified by the broker via Kubernetes TokenReview - no
# platform-minted credential anywhere in this path.
