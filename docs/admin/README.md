# platform-cicd: admin guide

Documentation for people **running** this platform - installing it, operating it,
and understanding why it's built the way it is. If you're an application developer
using an already-running platform, see [../user/](../user/) instead.

## Start here

| Doc | Read this when... |
|---|---|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | You want the current-state system overview. |
| [security.md](security.md) | You want the security model end to end - threat model, RBAC, supply chain, known gaps. |
| [installation.md](installation.md) | You're installing this platform on a cluster. |
| [onboarding-mechanics.md](onboarding-mechanics.md) | You're registering a new app onto an already-running platform. |
| [adr/](adr/) | You want to know why a specific decision was made this way. |
