# Release guardrails: adding and removing a gate

The release stage's governance checks (docs/release.md) are the platform's release
**guardrails** - independent, required GitHub Checks on every gitops-repo release PR.
This doc covers the mechanism that makes a gate a one-file (or two-file) addition rather
than a change scattered across half a dozen places, and the checklist for actually doing
that. See [governance-stubs.md](governance-stubs.md) for how a stub stays honestly a
stub, and [ADR-0003](adr/0003-governance-stubs.md) for why stubs are structurally loud
rather than a silent `exit 0` - this doc is the "how to add one" companion to that
decision, not a new one.

## The single source of truth

`charts/platform-cicd-catalog/values.yaml`'s `releaseGuardrails` list is the canonical
registry of every gate enforced on a release PR - `name`, a human `description`, and
`status` (`real` or `stub`, cosmetic only - see below). Two places render off it instead
of hardcoding the gate list:

- `catalog/tasks/detect-bypass-merge.yaml` - the break-glass Slack alert's "did every
  required check actually pass" loop.
- `catalog/tasks/open-release-pr.yaml` - the release PR body's governance-checks table.

Everything else about a gate - which Pipeline it runs, what it actually checks, whether
it posts a PR comment - is standard Tekton/PaC config, not driven by this list. Adding a
name to `releaseGuardrails` **alone does nothing**; the gate exists once its own
`.tekton/pull-request-<name>.yaml` onboarding template and Pipeline exist too (below).
Branch protection (which checks are actually *required* to merge) is a separate, manual
GitHub setting - see "Branch protection" below.

## Two shapes, depending on what the gate needs

**A. Independent stub or real check (the common case)** - most gates (sast, image-scan,
policy-check, sbom, itsm, qa, policy-validation) run in parallel off the same PR
webhook, with no dependency on each other's outcome:

- **Stub**: add one onboarding template file,
  `charts/platform-cicd-app/files/onboarding-templates/gitops-repo/pull-request-<name>.yaml`,
  pointing at the existing shared `governance-check` Pipeline with `gate-name: <name>`
  (copy `pull-request-itsm.yaml` as a starting point). That Pipeline already calls
  `governance-gate-stub` (loud "no real check implemented yet" logging + a
  `governance.stub=true` span + a `"stub"` result, never a silent pass) and posts a PR
  comment. **No new Pipeline or Task needed** - this is the whole change, plus the
  registry entry above.
- **Real**: once real logic exists, give the gate its own dedicated Pipeline (see
  `sbom-check.yaml` for the shape: one or more real Tasks, a `finally: comment-pr` block
  identical to every other gate's), and repoint that gate's onboarding template file at
  it instead of `governance-check`. Flip its `releaseGuardrails` entry to `status: real`.
  Nothing about the onboarding template file's *shape* changes, only the `pipelineRef`
  name and dropping `gate-name` (see `pull-request-sbom.yaml` vs. this doc's stub
  example for the before/after).

**B. A gate that depends on the others (currently just `image-promotion`)** - Tekton has
no cross-PipelineRun `runAfter` (every gate is its own independently PaC-triggered
PipelineRun off the same webhook, run in parallel - see `governance-check.yaml`'s own
header), so a gate that must run *after every other gate succeeds* needs its own
dedicated Pipeline that polls the GitHub Checks API for the rest. See
`image-promotion-check.yaml` and `catalog/tasks/wait-for-release-guardrails.yaml` - the
latter is generic (Helm-rendered off `releaseGuardrails`, minus the calling gate itself)
and reusable if a second such gate is ever needed.

## Timeouts: always split `tasks`/`finally`, never a single `pipeline` budget alone

**Found live 2026-08-23**: every onboarding template originally set only
`timeouts.pipeline` (e.g. `10m`) - a single shared budget for the real check tasks *and*
the `finally: comment-pr` step that reports the outcome. A check that ran merely slow
(not wrong) could burn the whole budget, leaving `comment-pr` no time to even start -
confirmed live: its pod sat `Pending`/`"containers with incomplete status"` for minutes,
then got `TaskRunCancelled` the instant the PipelineRun's own timeout hit, so the PR
never got a comment even though the underlying check itself had already produced a real
(if slow, or in one case never-finished) result.

Every onboarding template now sets `timeouts.tasks` and `timeouts.finally` explicitly
(not just `pipeline`) so `finally`/`comment-pr` always gets its own reserved window,
regardless of how long the real check tasks take:

```yaml
timeouts:
  tasks: "8m"      # budget for the real check task(s)
  finally: "2m"    # reserved, separate budget for comment-pr - never starved
  pipeline: "10m"  # must be >= tasks + finally
```

A new gate's onboarding template must set all three, not just `pipeline` - copy the
pattern from `pull-request-sast.yaml` (the default 8m/2m/10m split) or, if the real
check genuinely needs more room (see `pull-request-image-scan.yaml`'s 13m/2m/15m for
why Trivy scans got more), size `tasks` to what the check actually needs and keep
`finally` at 2m. `image-promotion` is the one exception with its own larger numbers,
since it has to out-wait every sibling gate's own timeout - see that onboarding
template's own header for the exact chain of reasoning.

## Current gates

| Gate | What it verifies | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `sast` | Static analysis (Semgrep) of the promoted commit's source | real |
| `image-scan` | Vulnerability scan (Trivy) of the promoted image | real |
| `policy-check` | Commit signature (gitsign) + SLSA provenance (Conforma) | real |
| `sbom` | Software bill of materials | real |
| `itsm` | ServiceNow Change Request | stub |
| `qa` | Test-completion verification | stub |
| `policy-validation` | Gatekeeper/Kyverno admission-policy validation of the rendered manifest | stub |
| `image-promotion` | Promotes the image from the dev registry to this env's upper registry - runs last, dependent on every gate above | stub |

`policy-check` and `policy-validation` are deliberately separate gates, not one - the
former is about the *commit*'s signer identity and the *image*'s provenance attestation
(docs/commit-signing.md, docs/provenance-policy.md), the latter is about the *rendered
manifest*'s compliance with cluster admission policy. Different failure modes, different
fixes, kept as independent required checks rather than folded together.

## Removing a gate

Delete its onboarding template file
(`charts/platform-cicd-app/files/onboarding-templates/gitops-repo/pull-request-<name>.yaml`)
and its `releaseGuardrails` entry. If it had a dedicated Pipeline/Task (a promoted-to-real
gate, or `image-promotion`'s Pipeline/Task), remove those too once nothing else
references them. Two things this does **not** do automatically:

- **Already-onboarded gitops repos** still have the old `.tekton/pull-request-<name>.yaml`
  file from a prior onboarding-resync - `deliver-onboarding-files.yaml` only ever adds
  missing files, it doesn't prune ones that disappeared from the template directory (a
  deliberate asymmetry - deleting a tenant's own customization was never the intent of an
  onboarding-resync PR). Remove the stale file from each gitops repo by hand (or via a
  one-off script) if the gate is really gone for good.
- **Branch protection** on the gitops repo's `main` still lists the old check name as
  required (see below) - a required check that no PR will ever produce again blocks every
  future release PR from merging until removed.

## Branch protection

Not IaC-managed by this platform (docs/release.md's own "Onboarding" section covers the
one-time per-repo setup) - `releaseGuardrails` and branch protection's required-status-
checks list are two independent settings that must be kept in sync **by hand**. Adding a
gate here without also adding it to branch protection means the check runs and reports,
but never actually blocks a merge. Removing a gate without removing it from branch
protection means every future release PR is permanently unmergeable (a required check
that will never run again). Neither mismatch is caught automatically - update both
together.

## Known open issue: `sast` fails closed on essentially every real release

**Found live 2026-08-23, not yet fixed - a platform decision, not a quick patch.** Two
gates failed in the same test run for what first looked like the same reason; live
evidence showed they're actually two different problems (see the `policy-check` fix
just above for the other one - a slow-but-legitimate `ec validate` policy evaluation
tripping its own 5-minute internal cap, now given more headroom).

`sast`'s failure is different and NOT fixed by a bigger timeout.
`verify-sast-attestation.yaml` re-verifies the Fulcio leaf certificate that Tekton
Chains attached to the *build*-time attestation, at *release-PR* time - necessarily
minutes later, since build->test->deploy->release all run first. This platform's Fulcio
issues leaf certs with a **10-minute validity window** (confirmed live: `openssl x509
-noout -dates` on the real cert used in the failed check, `notBefore`/`notAfter` exactly
10 minutes apart), and deliberately runs with Rekor/tlog verification disabled
(`transparency.enabled=false`, `--insecure-ignore-tlog=true` - see
docs/provenance-policy.md). Without a tlog entry to anchor "this cert was valid *at
signing time*", cosign has no choice but to check the cert against wall-clock *now* -
and by release-PR-check time it's routinely already expired. Confirmed with `openssl
verify`, not just cosign's own terse error: `error 10 at 0 depth lookup: certificate has
expired`. (`verify-image-provenance.yaml`'s own cosign check does the same
leaf-cert-against-now verification and is exposed to the identical risk - it happened to
still be inside the 10-minute window on this particular run, "Verified OK" printed right
before the unrelated `ec validate` timeout, but that's timing luck, not a guarantee.)

This is **structural, not a resource-contention flake**: any release where more than
~10 minutes elapse between the build stage and the release-PR check running (i.e.
essentially all of them - test+deploy+release plus PR-check scheduling delay reliably
exceeds 10 minutes) will fail `sast` closed, every time, regardless of cluster load, and
`policy-check` is one slow evaluation away from the same fate. The `image-scan`/`sbom`
gates aren't affected the same way - they scan/sign fresh at check time rather than
re-verifying an old cert.

Not fixed here because the real fixes are all bigger platform decisions than "reroute
the guardrails," and one of them was already tried and deliberately shelved:

- **Enable Rekor** (the sigstore-native fix - a tlog entry lets a later verification
  check cert validity *at signing time* instead of *now*). Previously attempted and
  abandoned after repeated live failures caused by this cluster's podman-VM instability,
  not a design objection - see the prior Rekor-install session notes. Would need to be
  re-attempted deliberately, not as a side effect of this work.
- **Run a Timestamp Authority (RFC3161)** as a lighter-weight alternative to full Rekor -
  cosign supports `--timestamp-server-url` for exactly this. Still new infrastructure to
  build and operate, not yet evaluated.
- **Do not** widen `--insecure-ignore-*` further to also ignore cert expiry - that
  discards the one thing short-lived-cert verification is actually for (proving the key
  that signed this wasn't already compromised/rotated away by the time anyone checks),
  not a fix.

Until one of these is decided and built, treat `sast`/`policy-check` failures on a real
release PR as expected/known, not a signal something regressed - `/retest` will not help
(the cert only gets *more* expired). Bypass sits behind existing break-glass tooling
(`detect-bypass-merge.yaml`, docs/release.md's "Break-glass" section) if a real release
needs to merge in the meantime.
