# platform-cicd: user guide

Documentation for **application developers** using this platform - not the people
running it. If you're onboarding a new app or maintaining one already onboarded, start
here.

The one-sentence version: you write a single `cicd.yaml` at your repo root, you push,
and the platform builds/tests/deploys/releases your app. You never write Tekton YAML,
never touch `.tekton/`, and never configure a CI server by hand.

## Contents

| Doc | Read this when... |
|---|---|
| [install-guide.md](install-guide.md) | You're onboarding a **brand-new app** for the first time. |
| [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) | Your app is already onboarded and you want your first pipeline running in the next five minutes. |
| [features.md](features.md) | You want the tour: what the platform does for you, beyond "runs my build." |
| [cicd-yaml-reference.md](cicd-yaml-reference.md) | You need to know exactly what a field does - the comprehensive, in-depth reference. |
| [examples/](examples/) | You know the shape of pipeline you want and just need a template to copy. |

The first four are ordered by depth on purpose: **install-guide** and **quickstart**
are short, step-by-step, and assume nothing. **features** and **cicd-yaml-reference**
are the deep material - read them when you need detail, not before.

## The big picture

Every stage below is a real Tekton Pipeline running in the platform's cluster - you
never see any of this directly, but it helps to know the shape of it when reading
error messages or wondering why something didn't fire.

![Pipeline flow: push triggers build, which chains through test, deploy, and release](diagrams/pipeline-flow.svg)

Two things worth internalizing from this picture before reading anything else:

1. **Only the first stage of a flow is triggered by your git push directly.** Every
   stage after that is triggered by the *previous stage's own completion event* - not
   by anything happening in GitHub. This is why the platform can chain
   build→test→deploy→release without you writing any orchestration - see
   [cicd-yaml-reference.md](cicd-yaml-reference.md#how-flows-work) for the mechanics.
2. **`release` never touches your running app directly.** It opens a pull request
   against a separate `gitops-<app-name>` repo and stops there - a human (or your
   branch protection rules) decides when that PR merges, and ArgoCD's own sync is the
   only thing that ever actually touches the target cluster. See
   [features.md](features.md#release-promotion) for why.
